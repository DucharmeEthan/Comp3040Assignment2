# Hosting Your Resume with GitHub Pages: A Modern Approach

## Purpose

- This README serves as a guide to hosting your resume on GitHub Pages, integrating the principles of Andrew Etter's Modern Technical Writing.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a well-formatted resume in Markdown. If you need guidance on Markdown, refer to this [tutorial](https://mszep.github.io/pandoc_resume/).
- An account with GitHub. If you do not have one please follow this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) to create one.

## Instructions

### 1. Setting Up Your GitHub Repository

- Navigate to your GitHub account at https://github.com/.
- Create a new repository named your-username.github.io (replace "your-username" with your actual GitHub username) by clicking on the green new button as show below. ![alt text](image.png)
- Fill out the required repository name on the page ensuring that the public option is selected and the Add a README file is set. Click Create Repository and you have set up the repository! ![alt text](image-3.png)
-

### 2. Preparing Your Resume in Markdown

- Open your preferred Markdown editor.
- Create a new Markdown file for your resume that is a file that has a .md ending.
- As Andrew Etter mentions in the Modern Technical Writing make sure that whatever style and format you choose for designing your markdown file you keep it consistent.
- My markdown resume follows the standard markdown styles with indented headers you can see that here: ![alt text](image-4.png)

### 3. Integrating Jekyll

- If you wish to explore Jekyll see the link [here](https://pages.github.com/themes/). Select a Jekyll theme that suits your preferences.
- This theme can be added to your github pages by adding a _config.yml file with the following code:
  ```remote_theme: pages-themes/"Your Chosen Theme" plugins: -jekyll-remote-theme```
- This can be done by clicking the create new file as followed by filling in the fields as seen below.

### 4. Uploading Your Resume

- Add your Markdown resume file to the repository. This can be done the same way as adding the _config.yml file. Copy your markdown resume on your computer then paste it on the spot that was previously the remote_theme. This time we are going to name your resume README.md.
- Click Commit the changes and push them to GitHub. You have now uploaded your Resume!

### 5. Activating GitHub Pages

- Go to your repository on GitHub. This will be located at `https://github.com/your-username/name-you-gave-it>`.
- Navigate to the "Settings" tab.
- Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.![alt text](image-5.png)
- Choose the branch containing your resume Markdown file. Since this is for beginners we leave it as main.
- You then choose /root so your settings should look like this:![alt text](image-6.png)
- Save the settings.

### 6. Verify Your Website

- Access <https://your-username.github.io/your_repository> in your browser.
- Ensure your resume is displayed correctly. It should look something like this: ![alt text](resume.gif)

## FAQS

### 1. Why is Markdown better than a word processor?

- Markdown offers simplicity, version control compatibility, and ease of collaboration. It also ensures consistent formatting across different platforms.

### 2. Why is my resume not showing up?

- Double-check your GitHub Pages settings, repository structure, and file names. Ensure the Markdown file is in the correct branch, and there are no typos in the file extension as these can all be causes of the resume not loading correctly.
